# Literature-Word-Count-Analysis
Used a combination of python and AI to generate the top 20 most common words in each text.  Stop words and words with only 2 or fewer letters were removed.
The resulting lists give accurate insight into the themes and subject matter of each text.

The Communist Manifesto lists words that reflect Marxist theory.  The top three are Class, Society, Bourgeoi.  Class is the central struggle, Society is the
battleground, and the Bourgeoisie are the "villains".  The 4th most common word is Proletariat, the good guys according to Marx.
